# Purpose of Project

The Restaurant Web App is designed to streamline the management of reservations, menu items, and restaurant operations. It aims to enhance the dining experience for customers by providing an intuitive platform for booking tables, while simplifying restaurant tasks for staff and administrators. The app is built to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and foster better communication between customers, staff, and management, ultimately creating a smoother, more enjoyable restaurant experience.

The primary users of the Restaurant Web App are customers, staff, and restaurant administrators. Customers use the platform to easily manage their reservations, browse menu items, and track their reservation status. Staff members interact with the app to manage and update reservations, ensure menu items are available, and assist with operational tasks. Administrators and managers utilise the app to oversee operations and analyse restaurant performance. Each group is provided with tailored functionality based on their role to ensure smooth and efficient restaurant operations.

# User Experience

This section details the key elements of the user experience (UX) design for the project, including visual design choices, color schemes, typography, and wireframes. It provides insight into the aesthetic and functional decisions made to enhance usability across different devices, ensuring a seamless and accessible experience for users.

## Design

### Fonts

The Montserrat font was used throughout the project for headings and prominent text. It's a clean, modern sans-serif font with a strong, professional look, making it ideal for a refined restaurant like Cedar and Flame. Its bold, uppercase styling helps convey a sense of sophistication and presence.

For body text, Open Sans was chosen due to its simplicity and high legibility, providing a comfortable reading experience for users. Its versatility and neutral design make it well-suited for longer content while maintaining a polished, cohesive aesthetic across the site.

### Colour
The following colour palette was used in the project:

![colour_palette](/readme_images/colours/cedar_and_flame_colour_palette.png)

- **#F5F5F5 (White Smoke)**: Used for body text to ensure readability on dark backgrounds, enhancing clarity for customers browsing the menu and staff interacting with data.
- **#FFD700 (Gold)**: Highlights important elements like headings and buttons. Gold conveys prestige and grabs attention, guiding users toward key actions like making reservations or submitting forms.
- **#333333 (Jet)**: Applied to buttons and navigation for contrast, ensuring that call-to-action elements are clear but not overwhelming, suitable for both customers and staff.
- **#444444 (Onyx)**: Used for card and form backgrounds to keep the design clean and focused, making menu items and forms stand out in a professional and minimalistic way.
- **#212121 (Eerie Black)**: Used for the footer to separate it from the main content and keep less central information accessible without distraction.

# Development Process

The development process for this project was carefully planned and documented to ensure efficient progress and transparency. This section outlines how the project was broken down into manageable tasks, tracked, and prioritized using GitHub Issues and Projects. It also covers the key steps taken, including project planning, SEO, data modeling, and data validation. Each sub-section provides a detailed look at the tools and methods used to guide development from initial planning to implementation.

## Project Planning and Documentation Using GitHub
GitHub Issues were used to document the development steps undertaken in the project. 
Two issue templates were created: one for [User Epics](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user-epic.md&title=USER+EPIC+%3A+%3CTITLE%3E) and another for [User Stories](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user-story.md&title=USER+STORY+%3A+%3CTITLE%3E).
A variety of labels were applied to categorise issue types, such as Bugs, User Epics and User Stories, with the parent epic and child story being associated with the same label for easy identificaion.
MoSCoW prioritisation was applied using the labels must-have, should-have, and could-have.

The project was broken down into manageable sprints using GitHub Projects, which provided a Kanban board. Issues were posted to the board and moved from "Todo" to "In Progress" to "Done" as they were completed. Due to time constraints, only Iteration 1 was completed, though future iterations were planned. This initial planning outlines the anticipated development of the application.

The iterations are documented here :
    - [Prerequisites](https://github.com/users/MFS4711/projects/6/views/1)
    - [Iteration 1](https://github.com/users/MFS4711/projects/5)

<!-- Include this section and add depth if time at the end -->
<!-- ## Search Engine Optimization
A set of long and short tail keywords was developed. 
The initial set was generated from a combination of brainstorming and examining the related searches returned by Google for these terms. This was then culled back to a smaller set of more targeted short- and long-tail keywords, which were each trialled on [wordtracker.com](https://wordtracker.com). 
This resulted in the following list of terms, ordered by volume:

|Term|Short/long-tail|Volume|Competition|
|---|---|---|---|
|'Word'|Short|226000|55.44|

After completing this research, I returned to the project's templates, and made the following changes:

- &lt;title> tag in base.html:
    - Set to '....'. This is one of the most important SEO locations ... -->
<!-- Add any tags in same form and bullet point impact of change -->

## Data Model
This section provides an overview of the data models used in the project, represented through Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for each application. Each sub-heading corresponds to a specific app, detailing its database schema and the relationships between key entities. These ERDs were drawn using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) and offer a clear visualization of how data is structured and flows within the application.

<!-- Add Apps and ERD Diagram for App -->

### Menu App

![Entity-relationship diagram for Menu App](readme_images/erd/ERD-menu.png)

#### `MenuItem` Table:
The `MenuItem` table stores information about individual menu items in the restaurant. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each menu item (primary key).
- `name`: The name of the menu item.
- `description`: A detailed description of the menu item.
- `image`: A field to store the image of the menu item using Cloudinary.
- `category`: The category of the menu item (e.g., appetizer, main course, dessert).
- `price`: The cost of the menu item.
- `is_available`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the item is available for ordering.
- `Created_at`: Timestamp for when the menu item was created.
- `Updated_at`: Timestamp for the last time the menu item was updated.

This structure allows for easy management and display of menu items, along with their availability and pricing details.

### Booking App

![Entity-relationship diagram for Booking App](readme_images/erd/ERD-booking.png)

#### `Table` Table:
The `Table` table stores information about tables available at the restaurant. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each table (primary key).
- `table_number`: The identifier or number of the table.
- `capacity`: The number of people the table can accommodate.
- `is_available`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the table is available for booking.

#### `User` Table:
The `User` table corresponds to the users in the system (using the Django user model for authentication and permissions). Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user (primary key).
- `username`: The user's chosen username.
- `email`: The user's email address.
- `password`: A hashed version of the user's password.
- `is_staff`: A boolean flag indicating if the user has staff privileges.
- `is_superuser`: A boolean flag indicating if the user has superuser privileges.
- `first_name`: The user's first name.
- `last_name`: The user's last name.
- `date_joined`: Timestamp for when the user account was created.
- `last_login`: Timestamp for the user's most recent login.

#### `Booking` Table:
The `Booking` table records reservations made by users for specific tables at certain times. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each booking (primary key).
- `user`: A foreign key linking to the `User` table, indicating who made the booking.
- `date`: The date of the reservation.
- `time`: The time of the reservation.
- `number_of_people`: The number of people included in the booking.
- `additional_notes`: Any extra details or special requests for the booking.
- `status`: The status of the booking (e.g., confirmed, pending, canceled), likely represented as an enum or choice field.
- `table`: A foreign key linking to the `Table` table, indicating which table is reserved.
- `created_at`: Timestamp for when the booking was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp for when the booking was last updated.

#### Relationships:
1. **User to Booking**: 
   - A one-to-many relationship exists between the `User` and `Booking` tables. One user can make multiple bookings, but each booking is made by a single user.
   
2. **Table to Booking**: 
   - A one-to-many relationship exists between the `Table` and `Booking` tables. Each table can have multiple bookings over time, but each booking refers to one specific table.

These tables allow the system to manage users, track reservations, and ensure that tables are properly allocated based on availability and bookings.

### Dashboard App

This app does not include any models. Its primary function is to retrieve and display relevant information in the appropriate views, with the associated functionality being managed by the corresponding app.

### Core App

This app does not contain any models. It is designed to serve as a container for the homepage and contact page, which do not require interaction with any models.

## Data Validation
<!-- List places where validators were used in model - i.e.price -->
<!-- If someone tries a negative number, error will occur and some action will happen - describe  -->
The following decimal fields, representing currency amounts, are protected by Django's MinValueValidator, with the minimum value being set at 0.

<!-- Also add any JS checks on form fields etc. to ensure desired action/errors are caught -->

### Responsiveness
All pages on the live site were tested with the default list of devices in Chrome Devtools. Special attention was given to ensuring the hero image carousel displayed optimally across screen breakpoints, with images specifically optimized for responsive viewing.

### Lighthouse
The Lighthouse testing was carried out using a chrome extension which can be found [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).
The results are displayed by page below:

<details>

## Validation Testing

### Python Validation

All python code is validated by the [Flake8 linter](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (installed in VSCode) and [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The exceptions to this were django migration files, urls and similar files. However, any custom models, views and forms were validated. I have separated this by app:

<details>
<summary>Core App</summary>

- views.py

- views.py

![menu_views_python_validation](/readme_images/python_validation/menu_views_python_validation.png)

</details>

### JavaScript Validation

All JavaScript code is validated by the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (installed in VSCode) and [JS Hinterface](https://mfs4711.github.io/jshint-api/). Custom JS was present only in the Booking and Menu Apps respectively.

<details>
<summary>Booking App</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Menu App</summary>

![menu_js-validation](/readme_images/js_validation/menu_js-validation.png)

</details>

### HTML Validation

All HTML was validating using the page source of the deployed project using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). All pages were clear of all errors/warnings. There was only one page where an additonal factor was noted. This was on the menu page which had an 'info' warning. This was related to the way the Cloudinary image is used in the menu item modal.

<details>
<summary>Menu Page</summary>

</details>

### CSS Validation

The single CSS file was validated using the [W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## User Story Testing
The User Epics and Stories for this project are documented across ... GitHub Projects, each corresponding to a specific iteration of the development work. You can find them here:

- [Iteration 1](link)
- [Iteration 2](link)
- etc .

Alternitively, the Epics and Stories are individually linked here :

- [Epics and Stories](#development-process)

In both cases, the status of each issue will indicate whether the user story has been completed.

## Automated Testing

### Testing django views, models and forms

Comprehensive automated testing can be seen for the Menu App where all CRUD functionalities are tested. This has partially been completed for the Booking App where the models are comprehensively tested but the forms/views are only partially tested as a related bug was being addressed.

<!-- A full suite of automated tests is included in the project. The tests for each app are located in the `test/` folder within each respective app and can be run using the following command :

`python3 manage.py test`

The most recent coverage report is available in the `htmlcov/` folder at the project's root. To view it, you can serve the report locally by running Python's built-in HTTP server from the root folder :

`python3 -m http.server`

To generate the coverage HTML report, use the following commands:

`coverage run manage.py test`

`coverage html` -->

# Deployment

This section provides a step-by-step guide for deploying your project to Heroku, ensuring that all necessary configurations and settings are in place for both development and production environments. Before deploying, you'll first clone the repository to your local machine to ensure that the original repo remains untouched during development. Follow these instructions to set up the app locally, deploy it to Heroku, and configure essential services like the database, social logins, and payment processing. By the end of this process, your app will be live and accessible on the web.

## Making a Local Clone
1. Open a terminal/command prompt on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository :

    `git clone 'REPO_LINK'`

<!-- May need to refactor section as maybe arrange it to first confirm  -->
## Running in Local Environment
<!-- Add steps taken - packages installed to ensure local environment works -->
<!-- Maybe remove common steps from heroku section -->

## Deploying to Heroku
1. **Log into Heroku** and navigate to the Dashboard.
2. Click the **'New'** button.
3. Choose a **unique app name** and select the region relevant to you.
4. **Create a Database** - As a student at Code Institute, I used [CI Database Maker](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) but this can also be achieved on Heroku by paying a monthly fee and following the below steps:
<!-- Add steps to create database here - i.e. Procfile and relevant code etc -->

5. Go to the **Settings** tab, and click **Reveal Config Vars**. Add the following config variables, if not already present:
    - **Django secret key**
    - **Database URL**
    - **Cloudinary API**
    - etc
    <!-- List all config vars visible - not giving their values -->
6. In your **local repository**, add a **Procfile** to the root directory with this content:

    `web: gunicorn strings-attached.wsgi`

7. Add your Heroku app URL to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in `settings.py`.
8. Create ... social apps for Facebook and Google login:
    - Add their API keys and Secrets to the database.
    - Configure your application details and callback URLs in the Google and Facebook OAuth dashboards.
    <!-- Amend this step based on if socials are used or not -->

9. Set `DEBUG` to `False` in `settings.py`, then commit and push your changes to GitHub.
10. Navigate to the **Deploy** tab in the Dashboard. Under **Deployment Method**, click the **GitHub** icon to connect your Heroku app to your GitHub repository.
    - Enter your repository name, click **Search**, then click **Connect**.
11. Under the **Manual Deploy** section, click **Deploy Branch**. Once deployed, you should see the message **"Your app was successfully deployed"**.
12. Click **Open App** to open the app in the browser.
