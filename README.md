![colour_palette](/readme_images/colours/cedar_and_flame_colour_palette.png)

- **#F5F5F5 (White Smoke)**: Used for body text to ensure readability on dark backgrounds, enhancing clarity for customers browsing the menu and staff interacting with data.
- **#FFD700 (Gold)**: Highlights important elements like headings and buttons. Gold conveys prestige and grabs attention, guiding users toward key actions like making reservations or submitting forms.
- **#333333 (Jet)**: Applied to buttons and navigation for contrast, ensuring that call-to-action elements are clear but not overwhelming, suitable for both customers and staff.
- **#444444 (Onyx)**: Used for card and form backgrounds to keep the design clean and focused, making menu items and forms stand out in a professional and minimalistic way.
- **#212121 (Eerie Black)**: Used for the footer to separate it from the main content and keep less central information accessible without distraction.

# Development Process

The development process for this project was carefully planned and documented to ensure efficient progress and transparency. This section outlines how the project was broken down into manageable tasks, tracked, and prioritized using GitHub Issues and Projects. It also covers the key steps taken, including project planning, SEO, data modeling, and data validation. Each sub-section provides a detailed look at the tools and methods used to guide development from initial planning to implementation.

## Project Planning and Documentation Using GitHub
GitHub Issues were used to document the development steps undertaken in the project. 
Two issue templates were created: one for [User Epics](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user-epic.md&title=USER+EPIC+%3A+%3CTITLE%3E) and another for [User Stories](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user-story.md&title=USER+STORY+%3A+%3CTITLE%3E).
A variety of labels were applied to categorise issue types, such as Bugs, User Epics and User Stories, with the parent epic and child story being associated with the same label for easy identificaion.
MoSCoW prioritisation was applied using the labels must-have, should-have, and could-have.

The project was broken down into manageable sprints using GitHub Projects, which provided a Kanban board. Issues were posted to the board and moved from "Todo" to "In Progress" to "Done" as they were completed. Due to time constraints, only Iteration 1 was completed, though future iterations were planned. This initial planning outlines the anticipated development of the application.

The iterations are documented here :
  - [Prerequisites](https://github.com/users/MFS4711/projects/6/views/1)
  - [Iteration 1](https://github.com/users/MFS4711/projects/5)
  - [Iteration 2](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/milestone/2)

## Data Model
This section provides an overview of the data models used in the project, represented through Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for each application. Each sub-heading corresponds to a specific app, detailing its database schema and the relationships between key entities. These ERDs were drawn using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) and offer a clear visualization of how data is structured and flows within the application.

### Menu App

![Entity-relationship diagram for Menu App](readme_images/erd/ERD-menu.png)

#### `MenuItem` Table:
The `MenuItem` table stores information about individual menu items in the restaurant. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each menu item (primary key).
- `name`: The name of the menu item.
- `description`: A detailed description of the menu item.
- `image`: A field to store the image of the menu item using Cloudinary.
- `category`: The category of the menu item (e.g., appetizer, main course, dessert).
- `price`: The cost of the menu item.
- `is_available`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the item is available for ordering.
- `Created_at`: Timestamp for when the menu item was created.
- `Updated_at`: Timestamp for the last time the menu item was updated.

This structure allows for easy management and display of menu items, along with their availability and pricing details.

### Booking App

![Entity-relationship diagram for Booking App](readme_images/erd/ERD-booking.png)

#### `Table` Table:
The `Table` table stores information about tables available at the restaurant. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each table (primary key).
- `table_number`: The identifier or number of the table.
- `capacity`: The number of people the table can accommodate.
- `is_available`: A boolean flag to indicate whether the table is available for booking.

#### `User` Table:
The `User` table corresponds to the users in the system (using the Django user model for authentication and permissions). Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each user (primary key).
- `username`: The user's chosen username.
- `email`: The user's email address.
- `password`: A hashed version of the user's password.
- `is_staff`: A boolean flag indicating if the user has staff privileges.
- `is_superuser`: A boolean flag indicating if the user has superuser privileges.
- `first_name`: The user's first name.
- `last_name`: The user's last name.
- `date_joined`: Timestamp for when the user account was created.
- `last_login`: Timestamp for the user's most recent login.

#### `Booking` Table:
The `Booking` table records reservations made by users for specific tables at certain times. Key fields include:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each booking (primary key).
- `user`: A foreign key linking to the `User` table, indicating who made the booking.
- `date`: The date of the reservation.
- `time`: The time of the reservation.
- `number_of_people`: The number of people included in the booking.
- `additional_notes`: Any extra details or special requests for the booking.
- `status`: The status of the booking (e.g., confirmed, pending, canceled), likely represented as an enum or choice field.
- `table`: A foreign key linking to the `Table` table, indicating which table is reserved.
- `created_at`: Timestamp for when the booking was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp for when the booking was last updated.

#### Relationships:
1. **User to Booking**: 
   - A one-to-many relationship exists between the `User` and `Booking` tables. One user can make multiple bookings, but each booking is made by a single user.
   
2. **Table to Booking**: 
   - A one-to-many relationship exists between the `Table` and `Booking` tables. Each table can have multiple bookings over time, but each booking refers to one specific table.

#### `on_delete` Considerations

- **User Deletion**:  
  If a user is deleted, the `Booking` records associated with that user are retained, and the `user` field in those records is set to `null`. This ensures that the historical booking data remains intact for analytics, but without a reference to a non-existent user.

- **Table Deletion**:  
  If a table is deleted, all bookings associated with that table will be deleted, ensuring no invalid references to missing tables exist in the system.

These tables allow the system to manage users, track reservations, and ensure that tables are properly allocated based on availability and bookings.

### Dashboard App

This app does not include any models. Its primary function is to retrieve and display relevant information in the appropriate views, with the associated functionality being managed by the corresponding app.

### Core App

This app does not contain any models. It is designed to serve as a container for the homepage and contact page, which do not require interaction with any models.

## Data Validation

Django Widget attributes have been used to provide min and max markers for form fields ensuring only values in a certain range can be submitted.

**Price validation** methods have been included in the `MenuItemForm` to prevent invalid inputs. Firstly, the Django Widget preventing numbers which are negative or more than 2 decimal places:

` widgets = {
        'price': forms.NumberInput(attrs={
            'min': 0.01,  # Minimum price value (cannot be zero or negative)
            'step': '0.01',
            'placeholder': 'Enter price',
            'class': 'form-control',
        }),
    } `

Also, a clean method was included in the form to provide another layer of safety like the above, raising a relevant validation error, and also adds functionality which ensures the number input is rounded to 2 decimal places ensuring consistent formating of pricing.

``` 
def clean_price(self):

        price = self.cleaned_data.get('price')

        if price is None or price == 0:
            raise ValidationError("Price must be greater than 0.")
        
        price = round(price, 2)

        if not re.match(r'^\d+(\.\d{2})$', f'{price:.2f}'):
            raise ValidationError(
                "Price must have exactly two decimal places.")

        return price 
```

# Testing

The Testing section covers various strategies used to ensure the application's functionality and quality. This includes **manual testing** for hands-on verification, **validator testing** to check data integrity, **user story testing** to confirm features meet user requirements, and **automated testing** to streamline repeated tests and ensure consistent performance throughout development. Each approach contributes to a robust, error-free application.

## Manual Testing

### Feature Testing
The manual testing of features is organised by app below. Testing was carried out on a 1920 x 1080 desktop screen, a Samsung tablet and an Samsung S22 Ultra.

### Responsiveness
All pages on the live site were tested with the default list of devices in Chrome Devtools. Special attention was given to ensuring the hero image carousel displayed optimally across screen breakpoints, with images specifically optimized for responsive viewing.

### Lighthouse
The Lighthouse testing was carried out using a chrome extension which can be found [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).
The results are displayed by page below:

<details>

## Validation Testing

### Python Validation

All python code is validated by the [Flake8 linter](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (installed in VSCode) and [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). The exceptions to this were django migration files, urls and similar files. However, any custom models, views and forms were validated. I have separated this by app:

<details>
<summary>Core App</summary>

- views.py

- views.py

![menu_views_python_validation](/readme_images/python_validation/menu_views_python_validation.png)

</details>

### JavaScript Validation

All JavaScript code is validated by the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (installed in VSCode) and [JS Hinterface](https://mfs4711.github.io/jshint-api/). Custom JS was present only in the Booking and Menu Apps respectively.

<details>
<summary>Booking App</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Menu App</summary>

![menu_js-validation](/readme_images/js_validation/menu_js-validation.png)

</details>

### HTML Validation

All HTML was validating using the page source of the deployed project using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). All pages were clear of all errors/warnings. There was only one page where an additonal factor was noted. This was on the menu page which had an 'info' warning. This was related to the way the Cloudinary image is used in the menu item modal.

<details>
<summary>Menu Page</summary>

## User Story Testing
The User Epics and Stories for this project are documented across 3 GitHub Projects, each corresponding to a specific iteration of the development work. However, as already mentioned only Iteration 1 has been addressed thus far with the remaining Iterations noted as part of future implementation. You can find the relevant Iterations here:

- [Iteration 1](https://github.com/users/MFS4711/projects/5)
- [Iteration 2](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/milestone/2)
- [Iteration 3](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/milestone/3)

Alternatively, the Epics and Stories are individually linked here :

- [Epics and Stories](#development-process)

In both cases, the status of each issue will indicate whether the user story has been completed.

## Automated Testing

### Testing django views, models and forms

Comprehensive automated testing can be seen for the Menu App where all CRUD functionalities are tested. This has partially been completed for the Booking App where the models are comprehensively tested but the forms/views are only partially tested as a related bug was being addressed.

Testing of the Booking Form raised an issue regarding the form validation preventing a user to submit a booking within two days of now. This issue has been mitigated through a django date widget which has been rendered to not allow selection of the invalid dates.

# Bugs

This section provides an overview of the bugs encountered during development, along with their resolutions. Any remaining issues or notable fixes are also tracked for reference.

Several bugs encountered during development and their solutions are documented in the GitHub issues tracker. Some notable examples include:
- [BUG - Form not submitting without modifying image field](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/45)
- [BUG - UX - Image preview only showing when original image is placeholder](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/44)
- [BUG - Validation HTML on Menu Page - Forms have duplicate ID's](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/48)
- [BUG - Table availability table not showing booking duration as occupied](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/47)
- [BUG - Table not visible 2 hours + before an existing booking](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/46)

## Remaining Bugs
There is currently one bug relating to staff cancelling a booking. This issue appears as the `StaffBookingForm` validation checks table availability before submission and so requires an available table to be assigned to the booking in order to submit the form. This is not ideal and so has been logged as a bug to be addressed. This does not impact a customer booking as the related forms do not require a table check. This bug can be seen below:

- [BUG - Staff Booking Form - Due to current form validation - to cancel a confirmed booking - staff need to assign an available table to the booking to submit a cancellation](https://github.com/MFS4711/Restaurant-Web-App/issues/49)

# Deployment

This section outlines the steps required to deploy your project to Heroku, ensuring that all configurations and settings are properly set for both development and production environments. Before proceeding with deployment, you will clone the repository to your local machine to safely develop without modifying the original codebase. Follow these steps to set up the app locally, deploy it to Heroku, and configure essential services such as the database, social logins, and payment processing. By the end of this guide, your app will be live and accessible on the web.

## Deploying to Heroku
1. **Log into Heroku** and navigate to the Dashboard.
2. Click the **'New'** button.
3. Choose a **unique app name** and select the region relevant to you.
4. **Create a Database** - As a student at Code Institute, I used [CI Database Maker](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) but this can also be achieved on Heroku by paying a monthly fee and following the below steps:
    - Head to the Resources tab.
    - Click on Find more add-ons.
    - Search for Heroku Postgres and select it, then click Install Heroku Postgres.
    - Pick a plan, then choose your app.
    - Go back to the Resources tab, click on the Heroku Postgres icon, and open the Settings tab. Click Database Credentials and copy the URL to your clipboard.
    - Paste this URL into your env.py file under the key DATABASE_URL. This ensures youâ€™re using the same database for both development and production environments.

5. Go to the **Settings** tab, and click **Reveal Config Vars**. Add the following config variables, if not already present:
    - **Django secret key**
    - **Database URL**
    - **Cloudinary API**

6. In your **local repository**, add a **Procfile** to the root directory with this content:

    `web: gunicorn cedar_and_flame.wsgi`

7. Add your Heroku app URL to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in `settings.py`.

8. Set `DEBUG` to `False` in `settings.py`, then commit and push your changes to GitHub.
9. Navigate to the **Deploy** tab in the Dashboard. Under **Deployment Method**, click the **GitHub** icon to connect your Heroku app to your GitHub repository.
    - Enter your repository name, click **Search**, then click **Connect**.
10. Under the **Manual Deploy** section, click **Deploy Branch**. Once deployed, you should see the message **"Your app was successfully deployed"**.
11. Click **Open App** to open the app in the browser.

## Making a Local Clone
1. Open a terminal/command prompt on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository :

    `git clone 'REPO_LINK'`

## Running in Local Environment
1. Create a virtual environment in the newly cloned project folder using:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Create an `env.py` file with the following environment variables:
    - `BASE_URL`: The root URL for the local dev project (usually `http://localhost:8000/`).
    - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL generated by Heroku (see the deployment section).
    - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: The URL provided by Cloudinary for storing media files. You can obtain this by signing up on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and generating your API credentials.
    - `DEBUG`: Set this to `True` for local development.
    - `PORT`: Default Django port, typically 8000.
    - `SECRET_KEY`: The Django secret key.
